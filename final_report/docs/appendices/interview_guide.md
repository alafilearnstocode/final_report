| Guide               | Timing     | Notes                                                                 |
|--------------------|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Introduction**   | 5 minutes  | Be patient and friendly to the interviewee, they are doing you a favor. |
| 1. Introduce yourself and thank the interviewee for taking the time to participate. |            |                                                                       |
| 2. Give a brief walkthrough of the interview so the interviewee knows what to expect without revealing the mockups. |            |                                                                       |
| **General Exploration** | 5–7 minutes | Keep questions open ended and do not cut off the interviewee if they are walking you through a story or a process. |
| 1. Ask about how the interviewee has dealt with dressing for the weather (if they face it). |            |                                                                       |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Let them describe their experiences. What was it like the first time they felt the impact of the cold in Evanston? |            |                                                                       |
| 2. Stay broad and avoid yes/no answers. |            |                                                                       |
| 3. Ask follow-up questions for brief or vague responses. |            |                                                                       |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. What have they done when finding clothes for the day? What works? What takes additional time? |            |                                                                       |
| **Detailed Exploration** | 5–10 minutes | Rotate which mockup is first introduced. Do not ask redundant questions and stop yourself from enforcing certain ways the interviewee should interact with the mockup. Ask follow-up questions. All mockups are the team’s mockup. |
| 1. Set the expectation that the mockups represent an idea. |            |                                                                       |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. The mockups may not be fully functional and do not look like a final product. |            |                                                                       |
| 2. Show the user the mockup and try to avoid giving them additional information beyond the mockup unless asked. |            |                                                                       |
| 3. Do not bias the interviewee into performing a certain action, see how well your mockup communicates your idea. |            |                                                                       |
| 4. Once the interviewee is familiar with the mockup and has used it, ask them questions about their experience. |            |                                                                       |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Tell me what you think. Reactions |            |                                                                       |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. How do you see this mockup helping individuals dress for the weather? |            |                                                                       |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i. Why? |            |                                                                       |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. What is lacking? |            |                                                                       |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i. Why? |            |                                                                       |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d. Is this something you could see implementing in your process? |            |                                                                       |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i. Why? |            |                                                                       |
| 5. Leave questions open ended. Understand rationale and important aspects. |            |                                                                       |
