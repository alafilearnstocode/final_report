# Appendix K: User Testing Summary 2.0

For the second round of user testing, we focused on collecting structured, quantitative feedback using a ratings-based approach. After initial open-ended feedback sessions proved to be more tense and subjective, we opted for a simplified Likert-style evaluation using two core metrics derived directly from our project requirements table:

1. **Functionality** — Solves the main problem: helping users (especially those unfamiliar with the Evanston weather) dress more appropriately.
2. **Aesthetically Pleasing** — The overall look and feel of the web application interface.

### Methodology

Participants were asked to rate the prototype on a scale of 1 to 10 for each of the two dimensions. All 6 testers completed the evaluation. These scores were then averaged and compared against our predefined ideal and allowable values from the original requirements.

### Results

| Participant | Functional Rating (Solves the Problem) | Aesthetically Pleasing Rating |
|-------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| User 1      | 7                                      | 8.5                           |
| User 2      | 5.5                                    | 6.8                           |
| User 3      | 8                                      | 6.75                          |
| User 4      | 9                                      | 9                             |
| User 5      | 6                                      | 8.5                           |
| User 6      | 8                                      | 7                             |

### Averages Compared to Requirements

| Metric                  | Average Score | Ideal Value | Allowable Value |
|-------------------------|---------------|-------------|------------------|
| Functional Rating       | 7.1           | 10          | 7                |
| Aesthetically Pleasing  | 7.76          | 10          | 6.5              |

### Interpretation

- The average **functional rating** was **7.1**, which meets the allowable value of 7. This suggests that the core objective—helping users dress appropriately—is being achieved, though not perfectly.
- The average **aesthetic rating** was **7.76**, which exceeds the minimum required threshold of 6.5. Most users found the interface reasonably visually appealing.

This structured method enabled clearer insight into the design’s performance while reducing the stress and ambiguity sometimes associated with subjective verbal feedback.
