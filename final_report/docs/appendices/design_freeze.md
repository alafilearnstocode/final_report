# Appendix F: Design Freeze

## Design Concept and Function:
Our team’s final solution to our problem, Northwestern students coming from outside the Midwest having trouble dressing appropriately for the weather, is an application called ClimateCloset. ClimateCloset is available on both mobile and desktop interfaces. When using ClimateCloset, users upload photos of their clothes and input their location. ClimateCloset analyzes the uploaded photos, classifies what clothes are shown in the photos, and puts the articles of clothing in a virtual wardrobe. 

Each day, users are presented with an outfit generated by ClimateCloset, which is deemed by the algorithm as appropriate for the weather in their set location. Users can customize this generated outfit by clicking through different articles of clothing that have been tagged as similar to the chosen clothes. If users do not have appropriate clothes for the day, the computer will insert a piece of clothing from our internal closet and indicate to the user that they are missing an essential piece of clothing. If a user has purchased new items, they can upload pictures of those clothes on any day or manually insert the clothes into the generated outfit. On the next day, users are given a pop-up window asking for feedback on the previous day’s outfit. This feedback form asks for a rating on the outfit’s warmth and style. Furthermore, there is also a written feedback section for more specific style or warmth concerns. With this feedback, ClimateCloset improves its algorithm to recommend outfits that address the users’ concerns. From our estimation derived from the price of tokens, the price of hosting user usage would be 50 cents per user per month.
