# Appendix M: Performance Testing 

## <u>Purpose</u>

The purpose of performance testing is to test different aspects of our final design without the users, such as request to response time, functionality on different screen sizes, and affordability. These aspects are independent of the users to measure how well our product works in general. 

## <u>Methodology</u>

2x Sweaters & Hoodies, 3x Shirts & Tops, 2x Jackets, 3x Pants & Other Lower, 3x Shoes & Footwear, and 1x accessories were uploaded into the performance testing wardrobe.

**Personalization:**
1. Outfit generation using user’s uploaded wardrobe (Y/N)

Performance testing wardrobe will be used to test whether the generated outfit will be purely based on the user’s uploaded apparels

**Functionality:**
1. Reliable to use on a daily basis 

To test reliability, we will ensure that there are a low amount of clear mistakes with outfit generation (as in no outfits that are missing shirts, pants, etc.).

2. Fast at responding to outfit generation

We will be testing response time to generate outfit out of our performance testing wardrobe. 

3. Quick to use (Minutes used to upload 20 clothes in the first try)

We created a completely new account and recorded the time it takes to upload 20 clothes

**Accessibility:**
1. Works on different screen sizes (Y/N)

The criterion was tested by testing the functionality of the product using laptops, mobile phones, and tablets with different screen sizes

2. Works on different browsers (Y/N)

The product was tested on Chrome and Safari to ensure consistency in layout and functionality.

3. Font size is large enough to read easily

Font size is large enough so that people do not have to strain to see the text

4. Large Button Size (points)

**Cost:**
1. Affordable to users 

The price of our product is designed to reflect and cover operational costs while remaining reasonable for users.
