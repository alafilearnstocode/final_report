# Appendix A: Need-Finding Research Summary

## Introduction
We were assigned to identify a white space—an unmet and recurring need that users face—and develop a solution to address it. This report entails the strategies we used to identify over 100 potential needs and details the process we followed to narrow them down to a single, focused need. We strived to obtain unmet needs from a wide range of audiences beyond the scope of Northwestern students. This allowed us to generate 100 ideas, which were then narrowed down to a single idea. We will show the criteria to explain the metrics we used to discard ideas in an objective way and eventually reach our one need. 


## Methodology
To discover a meaningful white space, our team used five different methodologies to gather a wide range of user needs: team members’ personal experience, interviews, questionnaires, web forums, and observations. This diverse approach allowed us to capture a comprehensive set of needs from various user groups, including students, working adults, and family members of various ages:


- ### *Personal Experience*:
Each team member reflected on their own day-to-day routines to identify challenges they face. This included needs related to adjusting to new environments, transportation issues, and daily inconveniences. For example, many of the group members have had personal struggles with the Midwest weather, such as Evanston wind messing up their hair, an umbrella being flipped during the wind, and their jeans sagging down in water. The cluster of weather problems eventually helped inspire our final direction. 


- ### *Interviews*:
We conducted in-person interviews with peers, family members of various ages, and friends using open-ended questions about their unmet needs. An idea that we received from interviewing with a group member’s mother is that their dog always ends up leashing around people when running. These conversations allowed for follow-ups and deeper insights. Many of the needs generated from interviews made it into our top shortlist due to the detail and thoughtfulness in responses.




- ### *Questionnaire*:
We distributed a short online questionnaire to gather needs in a structured but flexible format. Respondents were asked to list recurring issues and product limitations. This yielded 22 responses and over 30 unique needs, many of which were validated by the willingness of respondents to offer further clarification.


- ### *Web Forums*:
We explored online communities within Reddit, such as r/problemhunt, r/SomebodyMakeThis, and r/lifehacks, to observe what users frequently complain about or wish existed. These sources helped us identify pain points that were not always visible through personal networks.


- ### *Observations*:
Our team paid close attention to user behavior and frustrations in real-world contexts, such as on campus(Tech, Norris, Mudd) and during daily commutes. These informal observations helped uncover problems users may not explicitly mention or realize in questionnaires or interviews.


## Getting down to 25 Needs
Starting from our full list of 100 needs, we applied 4 rounds of eliminations to arrive at 25 needs. Firstly, we removed any ideas that the team thought were “Hard NOs”: topics that we just weren’t very passionate about. We eliminated 39 ideas in this phase. We then removed 16 needs that were deemed ‘Not Feasible’: problems that we believed just weren’t practical for us to solve within the time frame of 4-10 weeks. We eliminated another 15 problems that we knew had existing solutions. Finally, in an open discussion during the group meeting, we debated the remaining ideas and made the final eliminations based on overall enthusiasm and potential impact on users to settle the list at 25.  


## Getting down to 1 need
From our shortlist of 25, the elimination of ideas was no longer very clear-cut for us. As a result of that, we gathered as a group and discussed thoroughly each idea in depth. This includes researching whether existing solutions already address the problem, evaluating the feasibility of our own solution, and, most importantly at this stage, deciding whether we’re willing to dedicate the rest of the quarter to it. We first narrowed things down to two finalists: stuck drawstrings and necklaces that are hard to remove, using our criteria of team interest, technical feasibility, and gaps in existing solutions. 
However, while we were interested in certain aspects of both ideas, we still weren’t convinced that these were problems that we are passionate about. We introduced our idea to our professors, and they raised similar concerns about how the scope of the problem might be too narrow. It seemed to us that there was one simple solution to each of the problems, and we didn’t feel the passion to research and iterate along each of the paths. While we were struggling with choosing the idea, we were inspired by the weather idea that was presented earlier as a part of another team’s 25 ideas. After learning that the other DTC group had scrapped the idea and received approval to pursue it ourselves, we revisited our original list of 100 ideas to find a common theme. We noticed a cluster of weather-related problems: jeans sagging in a downpour, hats blowing off in gusts, Evanston wind wrecking your hair. We found that they are all pointing to one root problem: not knowing how to dress for the weather. Recognizing how common and impactful this frustration is, we chose “outfit inspiration based on real-time weather” as our single, final need. Most importantly, all group members unanimously felt significantly more passionate and excited about solving this problem. 


## Conclusion
Our team set out to identify an unmet, recurring user need with the goal of designing a meaningful and practical solution. By gathering over 100 needs through a wide range of methods and carefully narrowing them down using clearly defined criteria, we were able to arrive at a final need that reflects both real-world relevance and user frustration. Through our elimination process, we identified a common pattern among several distinct issues: many of them stemmed from the challenge of dressing appropriately for unpredictable weather conditions. This insight led us to our final selected need: helping users generate outfit inspiration based on real-time weather, using their own wardrobe. Going forward, we plan to research further by identifying our users using a survey and interviewing them to understand their specific needs.
