# Appendix E: User Testing Summary

## Introduction
On 7th May, 2025, our team conducted a series of user testing sessions to gather feedback on all four of our mockups developed for a product intended to help students dress appropriately for Evanston’s unpredictable weather. These mockups included: the Sectioned Wardrobe, the Clothes-Share, the Style Chatbot and the Style Uploader. Our goal was to observe and understand how participants interacted with each mockup, and identify pain points or areas of improvement.

All the user testing was conducted in-person at 710 Emerson St. Each session lasted about 30 minutes and was conducted by at least 3 team members in rotating roles as designated:
- Primary Interviewer: guided the session and introduced the mockup
- Notetakers: ensured feedback collection in the form of notes
- Observer: took note of user reactions and interactions

We tested with six students who met our screening criteria: international or domestic students who reported struggling with dressing appropriately for the weather. The findings from the testing session will inform the refinement of our design approach towards our final prototype.

## Methodology
### Overview
Our team tested the four distinct mockups with six participants with a goal of simulating early-stage interactions with each design and gathering qualitative data on clarity, usability, desirability and perceived usefulness. Testing followed a semi-structured interview format conducted in-person, allowing us to observe real-time interactions and probe deeper into user reasoning.

### Mockups
1. <u>**Sectioned Wardrobe:**</u> A proposed closet organisation system that segments clothing by weather usability. Figure 1 illustrates a potential use case with a sequence beginning with a user wondering what to wear, then checking the weather forecast, which shows that it is 45°F and rainy in Evanston. The user opens a neatly segmented wardrobe, with clothing organised by temperature ranges and weather conditions. Inner layers and pants are stored on shelves labelled with temperature brackets while outerwear is hung on racks categorised by both temperature and specific weather scenarios such as rain. We also have an accessories section containing items like hats. In the final frame, the user finally assembles an outfit based on the wardrobe layout.

2. <u>**Clothes-Share:**</u> A rental-based clothing access system allowing students to borrow weather-appropriate clothing items. Faced with unexpectedly cold and windy conditions, a student uses a QR code to access the Clothes-Share app, registers, and selects a jacket. The app tracks usage time, location, and pricing with rental options ranging from one to twelve hours. After use, the student returns the jacket to an empty locker and confirms the return through the app. The final panel shows a student who is warm and comfortable after renting a jacket. (Figure 2)

3. <u>**Style Chatbot:**</u> A conversational assistant that suggests daily outfits based on weather and student preferences. Figure 3 showcases our mockup and it is like a conversational assistant that generates personalised outfit suggestions based on real-time weather and user preferences. The interface prompts the user to input details such as occasion, style preferences and additional information. Using weather data, the chatbot recommends an appropriate look with accompanying visual suggestions offering a clear preview of outfit options.

4. <u>**Style Uploader:**</u> A wardrobe digitisation tool that lets students upload their clothing items and receive daily outfit recommendations based on weather and style preferences. Users can swipe through different outfit combinations in a vertical carousel format and receive a score rating to show the suitability of the outfit. We intend to integrate user-owned wardrobe data and weather data to personalise the outfits.

### Testing Procedure
Each session followed a consistent structure relying on questions from the interview observation guide and screener:
    1. Introduction (5 mins): We introduced ourselves, provided an overview of the testing session and ensured informed verbal consent was obtained.
    2. General Exploration (5-7 mins): We asked open-ended questions to understand participants’ past experiences dressing for Evanston weather, their daily routines, and problem-solving habits. 
    3. Mockup Testing (5-10 mins per mockup): The participants interacted with each mockup (rotated in random order across sessions) while team members observed and noted their responses and we only provided clarifications upon request to avoid bias.
    4. Mockup-Specific Questions: We each prepared and asked follow-up questions regarding each mockup to gather more specific feedback. (DTC Interview/Observation Guide)
    5. Wrap-Up (5 mins): We thanked participants for their time and asked for any final thoughts.

Our observations were focused on what participants said, how they physically interacted with our mockups, what questions they asked and what emotions or hesitations they expressed.

## Results

### Sectioned Wardrobe
Many participants found the Sectioned Wardrobe concept visually appealing but raised concerns about its practicality with the main concern being the ongoing effort required to maintain a sorted wardrobe with several noting that it would feel “annoying” or “tiring” to regularly re-organise clothing. The label process was another area of concern particularly around who would be responsible for generating and applying labels to each item. Participants also questioned the overall usefulness of the concept suggesting that its true value might only emerge with longer-term use. Other participants, especially those with smaller wardrobe sizes felt the concept was unnecessarily elaborate for their needs, indicating that its utility may be limited to users with larger or more complex clothing collections.

### Clothes-Share
Many participants expressed their discomfort with the concept of sharing clothes primarily due to concerns around hygiene, convenience and responsibility. Many felt uneasy about renting or sharing clothing, citing worries about cleanliness and the burden of returning items properly. The idea was largely seen as inconvenient, with some participants stating that they would rather return to their dorms than use the service. Pricing and inventory availability also emerged as points of scepticism, with participants questioning whether the cost would be justified and whether enough clothing would be on hand during peak demand. While a few found the concept appealing in theory, they emphasised that its viability would depend on strict hygiene standards and a secure, possibly deposit-based, rental system.

### Style Chatbot
Participants responded largely positively to the Style Chatbot but emphasised the need for a more streamlined output interface with a key critique being that the chatbot returned excessive text which made the suggestions feel overwhelming. Participants expressed a strong preference for more concise and organised outputs such as bullet points, keywords or outlined formats. There was also a clear desire for visual accompaniment, with several suggesting that combining images with text would enhance clarity and engagement. Concerns were raised about personalisation, especially how the chatbot could generate relevant suggestions without access to the user’s actual wardrobe. These insights were informed by direct interaction with the prototype which revealed not only conceptual feedback but also practical usability concerns that would not have been evident through passive review alone (Figure 5).

### Style Uploader
Participants generally viewed the process of uploading their wardrobe as a major barrier with some describing it as too time-consuming. While some proposed workarounds such as uploading benchmark items, swiping to confirm or inputting categories, there was a clear need for simplification. Several also expressed interest in added functionality such as laundry tracking to prevent repeated suggestions. While the concept was seen as useful, especially for special occasions, participants emphasised that they would engage with it if the interaction was fast and intuitive, with filters and a streamlined UI.

## Discussion
### Sectioned Wardrobe
While the idea was understood and appreciated in theory, most participants found the act of maintaining a sectioned wardrobe unrealistic or too much effort in practice with even more concerns regarding labelling and ongoing maintenance surfacing repeatedly. These limitations suggest that the concept may serve a niche group with high clothing volume or interest in organisation but it is likely too high-fiction for broader adoption. As a result, the concept may be better suited as an optional add-on or feature in a more comprehensive wardrobe app rather than a standalone solution.

### Clothes-Share
The concept faced strong resistance across all participants. Major concerns include hygiene, pricing and general inconvenience due to the usage times. Although a few saw potential in emergency scenarios, particularly if cleanliness and ease of use were guaranteed, the model’s underlying assumption that students would routinely engage with communal clothing proved unrealistic. These reactions point to a need for rethinking the user context and limiting the concept to highly specific, opt in use cases.

### Style Chatbot
Participants were receptive to the chatbot as a low-effort supportive tool. The main feedback centered around output format with users preferring bullet points, keywords or visual pairings instead of long text blocks. If further customised through wardrobe data or personal preferences, there is strong potential for adoption as a seamless part of students’ daily routines especially for those who find outfit planning burdensome.

### Style Uploader
Despite being the most conceptually ambitious, this mockup sparked the most enthusiasm with nearly all participants seeing potential in the long-term utility. However, the onboarding process of uploading and categorising clothing items was flagged as a major barrier. Additional interest centered around laundry tracking and style-based filtering. These features are not just desired, they are essential to making the idea feel smart, dynamic and worth the setup effort. While the set up of these features is demanding, users were willing to invest in it if the system proved easy to navigate over time.

## Conclusion
The Style Uploader and Style Chatbot mockups received the most positive responses from participants, largely due to their clear functionality and actionable suggestions for improvement. Users saw strong potential because the required adjustments such as streamlining text output or wardrobe input were viewed as realistic and feasible. In contrast, the Clothes-Share concept was met with broad scepticism, with hygiene, cost and convenience concerns undermining its viability. Similarly, the Sectioned Wardrobe was seen as too dependent on user motivation and daily effort, limiting its potential for widespread use though it may hold appeal for highly organised users. Across all feedback, a consistent theme emerged: participants want personalised, visually engaging and low effort solutions that minimise the need for frequent user input.

## Limitations
The sample size was small (6 participants), which limits the statistical generalisability of results. Moreover, since mockups were low-fidelity, user interaction was limited to conceptual feedback rather than full prototype engagement. This means the insights gathered may not fully reflect real-world usage. Furthermore, users may have self-censored their feedback due to social desirability bias. Time constraints also posed a limitation, as the testing sessions were limited to approximately 30 minutes. As a result, we had limited opportunity for deeper probing into feature prioritisation and long-term use patterns.
