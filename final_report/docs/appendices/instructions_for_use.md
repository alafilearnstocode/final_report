# Appendix J: Instructions for Use

The instructions to set-up and navigate ClimateCloset are detailed below.

<u>Initial Set-Up</u>

1. Scan the QR code (Figure 1) to reach the ClimateCloset website. On the initial screen (Figure 2), users can create an account by entering their full name, email address, and creating a password. Afterwards, users can sign into an existing account.

2. After creating an account, users are directed to take photos of their clothing. People can add apparel from their closet to the app in the ‘Your Wardrobe’ section by clicking the shirt icon at the bottom of the screen. Take a photo for each of your apparel items, however you like, and select the category. AI will do the rest for you (Figure 3).

<u>Daily-Use</u>

1. Press the ‘Create your outfit for today button’ (Figure 4). 

2. Fill in the preferences for your outfit: How active?, When you’ll be out?, What occasion? (Figure 5, 6).

3. After filling in all your preferences, you can go ahead and generate the outfit!

<u>Next Day</u>

1. Give feedback on yesterday’s outfit so that the system can learn about your temperature tolerance. This can be found in the calendar section. 

2. Our system will automatically analyze what clothes will be moved to the ‘wash’ pile, so no need to worry about that!
