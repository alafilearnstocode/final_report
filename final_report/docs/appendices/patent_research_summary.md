# Appendix C: Patent Research Summary 

When ideating for our design challenge, helping students dress for the weather in unfamiliar environments, our team researched different patents to evaluate existing solutions and identify potential weaknesses in these solutions. We researched patents about weather forecasting, clothing recommendations, clothes sharing, and closet design.

## Adaptive Weather Interrogation System
Publication Date: March 13, 2014 <br />
This patent includes a system intended to provide the optimal weather information. This system uses two types of data: weather data (including but not limited to wind, temperature, and turbulence) from external sources and user-inputted requirements. Some user-inputted criteria are weather quality, accuracy, and confidence.

This patent introduces the idea of weather forecasting accuracy’s impact on dressing appropriately for the weather. While more accurate information about the weather could assist people struggling to dress appropriately for the weather, having more information would not help individuals who do not have a baseline understanding of personal temperature preferences and what they would wear in those conditions. For example, someone who has spent their entire life in environments warmer than 70℉ would understand they should wear more layers in colder weather, but may be uncertain whether a heavy winter coat is necessary at 50℉ or 30℉.

## System and Method for Fashion Recommendations
Publication Date: March 30, 2021 <br />
Expiration Date: November 29, 2037 <br />
This patent introduced a tool that provides individuals, including those with visual impairments, with fashion recommendations based on machine learning and user data. When using this system, the user inputs information about preferred colors and measurements to generate a virtual closet with recommended clothes. Furthermore, users can take photos of existing clothes and upload them to their virtual closet. Users can form outfits from the clothes in their virtual closet and receive input from machine learning methods. These machine learning methods take account of calendar events, weather forecasts, event settings, sales trends, and what outfits the user has previously liked. This system also includes the collection of user data for retailers and manufacturers to improve their businesses.

While the system described in this patent accounts for the weather forecast in its recommendation system, the app focuses on clothing recommendations based on color. When looking into this patent, a concern that arises is the obscurity of the applications of this idea. Although this patent has a thorough explanation of how machine learning can be used to help users dress for the day, these ideas are not adopted into widely used applications. For example, some fashion apps use machine learning to market clothes, but these applications do not take into account their users’ current wardrobe. The applicant of this patent, Color Butler, Inc., appears to have a website with an application that uses this system, but the app is not widely used or implemented. A website may be more widely accessible. 

## Method and System for Sharing Clothes
Publication Date: July 27, 2020 <br />
Expiration Date: September 20, 2039 <br />
This patent outlines a method that allows foreign travelers in Korea to borrow clothes through an application with three interfaces: the sharer side, the laundry side, and the delivery side. When using the application, the borrower can see where the clothes they want to borrow are and the rental prices for the clothes. The clothes are exchanged at third-party locations, such as lockers or clothing stores. After the borrowed clothes are worn, the clothes are sent to a laundry service and returned to the original owner.
While this method does not account for the weather, a clothes-sharing service could help students without the appropriate clothes for unfamiliar environments. One key consideration is cleanliness, many students are concerned about the cleanliness of clothes they are wearing, especially if they are coming from unknown individuals, which highlights the importance of the laundry implementation in this patent. Although students may initially rely on borrowing clothes, this is unlikely to become a long-term solution for students, since they will invest in appropriate garments as they become more accustomed to their environment.

## Garment Organization and Identification Apparatus
Publication Date: August 23, 2018 <br />
This patent includes a permanent tag used for identifying and organizing clothes. The tag contains two circular holes connected by a slim rectangular hole between them. Clothing hangers can be strung through the circular holes to tag the clothes, and the two holes on the tag ensure that two related pieces of clothing can be tagged together.

The apparatus described in this patent does not account for weather, but its application can be extended to identifying and grouping clothes for specific weather conditions or temperatures.
