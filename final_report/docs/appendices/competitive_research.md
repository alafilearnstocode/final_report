# Appendix D: Competitive Benchmarking Research Summary

After patent research, our team conducted research into potential competitors. To find products that aimed to solve a similar problem to ours, we first conducted internet research, using search queries such as “weather-based outfit apps”.

Next, for each product:
- If the product was software-based, we read the corresponding app-store or web reviews 
- If the product was physical, we read through the corresponding Amazon reviews to gather extra information

Finally, we cross-referenced as many products as we could with opinions found on web forum websites such as Reddit and Quora. 
For each entry, we:
1. Summarize the product: This helps us assess how similar the goals of the product are to our own project. 
2. Provide one high rating and one low rating: This helps us gauge a strength and weakness of the product
3. List unique features this product offers: This helps us understand what moat (or defining feature that keeps customers) the product may have
4. List pricing information: This helps us understand the market positioning of each product and how accessible or premium it is for potential users.

## Weather Based Outfit Apps

### Weather Fit (iOS)
Weather Fit (see Figure 1) is an iOS app that allows users to create a personalized avatar which then dresses according to real time weather information. The app suggests outfits for the current day, night, and the next day, with avatars holding an umbrella, sunglasses or other accessories depending on the weather. The app also offers widgets for the home and lock screen to check info quickly. 

Although the app has a customizable avatar, there do not seem to be any options for uploading clothing that the user owns themselves. Additionally, the app has been designed for weather information over fashion. This differs from our own product which is specifically focused on being fashion-forward.

<p align="center"><em><a name="cite-1">*Figure 1: Weather Fit App Image*[<a href="#source-1">1</a>]</a></em></p>

**Pricing information:** Free for the basic version, $1.99/month for the premium version <br />
**Rating information:** 4.6/5 stars on the iOS app store based on 3.6k ratings 

**Positive Rating:** <a name="cite-2"> “This is a fun, cheerful way to choose your outfit for the day… This app with its Home Screen widgets is a fun way to check the weather… Since the app is so cute, and the developer willing to add character features, I decided to purchase a lifetime subscription so I can watch it develop” [<a href="#source-2">2</a>].</a> 

**Critical Rating:**<a name="cite-2"> “Super cute app. Great idea, pretty well executed for the most part. The only issue I have with it is it’s inaccurate and almost always a few degrees off. For example, I’ll go into this app and it’ll tell me the temperature is 103°F, whereas if I look at the default weather app on my phone or on Google it’ll be something like 105°F”[<a href="#source-2">2</a>].</a> 

**Other:**
- <a name="cite-3">One user on Reddit mentioned that the Weather Fit app was “fantastic” and helped them “find clothing to wear” [<a href="#source-3">3</a>].</a> 

### Weatherproof (Android & iOS)
Weatherproof (see Figure 2) is an android/iOS app that recommends specific clothing items based on a detailed forecast analysis. The app will be as specific as telling you if you need an umbrella or raincoat due to wind, or if you should wear a thin vs. thick jacket, scarf, gloves, and hat. It even will provide information on UV exposure and corresponding sunscreen to wear. The app is also highly customizable, with profiles for different levels of activity. 

This app definitely seems to put functionality before beauty, and provides detailed information for clothing, but does not customize clothing recommendations to what the user has in their wardrobe. Several reviews also mentioned that the app needed a UI upgrade. Given the level of specificity and the prioritization of functionality above all else, we believe that the target audience for this product are individuals who need to know exactly what type of clothing to wear, but do not want specific recommendations over their items of clothing. This group potentially includes people who need to help their children dress for the weather. In my opinion, since this app is so oriented towards functionality over fashion, it is unlikely that our target audience would use it.

</p>
<p align="center"><em><a name="cite-4">*Figure 2: Weatherproof App Image*[<a href="#source-4">4</a>]</a> </em></p>

**Pricing information:** Free  <br />
**Rating information:** 4.7/5 stars on the Google Play app store based on 667 ratings (10k downloads)

**Positive Rating:** <a name="cite-5">“Comes EXTREMELY handy when your a parent and need to know some ideas on what may be suitable for your child/children to wear and be as comfortable in whichever mood the weather has in store” [<a href="#source-5">5</a>].</a> 

**Critical Rating:**<a name="cite-5"> “The navigation graphics are not intuitive, and the overall look/feel is clumsy and not aesthetically pleasing”[<a href="#source-5">5</a>].</a> 

### PackPoint (Android & iOS)
Packpoint (see Figure 3) is a travel app that helps users pack clothing for trips by analyzing the trip’s weather and taking inputs about the trip’s activities. The difference between Packpoint and other daily outfit apps is that Packpoint is meant to be used before a trip. After inputting your destination, information about when your trip will take place, and the activities you plan to do on your trip, Packpoint will generate a detailed packing list with weather factored in. 

Although the average reviews are very high, it seems like recent reviews are low. Users mainly complain about the app being too one-size-fits all, and needing to pay for the premium version to get features that make the app worth using. 

Relating this app to our own design, several features that we can definitely take into account include the ability to specify what type of activity you will be doing and the ability to store your own wardrobe virtually. We also think the interface, although old-looking, is quite nice.

</p>
<p align="center"><em><a name="cite-6">*Figure 3:Packpoint App Image*[<a href="#source-6">6</a>]</a> </em></p>

**Pricing information:** Free for basic, $2.99 for premium  <br />
**Rating information:** 4.6/5 stars on the Google Play app store based on 41k ratings (1M downloads)

**Positive Rating:**<a name="cite-7"> “Probably the best packing app I've found since switching from Packing Pro on the iPhone. Trouble with most of these apps is that they come preconfigured with loads of categories filled with hundreds of items you'll never use, yet they can't be edited, on this they can, and with ease” [<a href="#source-7">7</a>].</a> 

**Critical Rating:** <a name="cite-7"> “While this app may provide base-level functionality, it lacks two features that make it useless to me. One is that trips cannot be shared across multiple devices and the other is that customized templates and activities don't seem to be available across different trips”[<a href="#source-7">7</a>].</a> 

### Cladwell (Android & iOS)
Cladwell (see Figure 4) lets you build or import a digital closet by taking a picture of your clothing and removing the background. It will then suggest a daily outfit based on the local forecast and how often you’ve worn an item. One highlighted feature is the ability to organize wardrobes into “capsules” with themes such as “work”, “weekend”, or “study abroad”. They also have introduced an “AI-stylist” to answer questions about what clothing to wear. 

Cladwell is very similar to several software-related ideas we have had. I believe that this competitor probably matches our target audience (which is equally balanced in terms of functionality and fashion) the most. This is a product that is worth doing more research into on an individual level. However, at a brief look, it seems like a lot of work for users to maintain their digital “capsule wardrobe”, so we could improve this in our own design by streamlining the process of adding clothes, or potentially creating features that let users receive suggestions.

</p>
<p align="center"><em><a name="cite-8">*Figure 4: Cladwell App Image*[<a href="#source-8">8</a>]</a></em></p>

**Pricing information:** Free for basic, unclear about premium pricing  <br />
**Rating information:** 4.1/5 stars on the Google Play app store based on 465 ratings (50k+ downloads)

**Positive Rating:**<a name="cite-9"> “Almost perfect! This is a great app and makes it easy to see all of your options. I wish that you could log more than one outfit per day. I also wish that you could have multiple layers to an outfit”[<a href="#source-9">9</a>].</a>

**Critical Rating:**<a name="cite-9"> “Wouldn't recommend this app, even if it were free. The process of adding your entire wardrobe is tedious and time-consuming, and the recommendations are disappointing. The AI is practically useless… Additionally, it suggests completely inappropriate items, such as sandals and beachwear, for a winter capsule in NYC”[<a href="#source-9">7</a>].</a> 

## Physical Solutions

### Acurite “What to Wear”
The AcuRite What‑to‑Wear Weather Station (see figure 5) is a battery‑powered bedside clock and outdoor thermometer that visually shows users how to dress. The target audience for this product is children. The device is able to get weather information through a wireless sensor meant to be placed outside. Additionally, dressing correctly earns the user a virtual star, which gamifies the experience of getting dressed. 

The target audience of this product differs from the target audience of our product, which is mainly fashion-oriented college-age individuals. However, the idea of having a bedside panel is interesting and worth looking into.

<p align="center"><em><a name= "cite-10">*Figure 5: Acurite “what to wear” product image*[<a href="#source-10">10</a>].</a> </em></p>

**Pricing information:** $25.47 on Amazon  <br />
**Rating information:** 4.5/5 stars on Amazon based on 113 reviews

**Positive Rating:**<a name= "cite-11"> “Bought as a gift for a family member. Easy to setup and is accurate. The "what to wear" little person is pretty neat. Wish it had indoor temperature.”[<a href="#source-11">11</a>].</a> 

**Critical Rating:**<a name= "cite-11"> “Temperature’s not accurate. Temperature number is bigger than the time. Only one alarm. Would not buy”[<a href="#source-11">11</a>].</a> 

### Vyu Smart Mirror
Vyu Smart Mirror
Vyu Smart Mirror (see Figure 6) is an AI-powered digital mirror designed to be used in retail environments. It uses generative AI and computer vision to show potential customers what certain clothing items might look like on them. This is done by having the user stand in front of the mirror and using AI to generate images of the user with different outfits on. 

Although this product is not targeted at general consumers (the smart mirror is a B2B product built to help drive customer engagement in retail stores), the technology of using AI to visualize outfits could actually be used within our own project. For instance, we could have users take pictures of themselves, and “try on” different outfits suggested by our own machine learning model. 

We could even go a step further, and use the user's computer screens as a mirror by having the user stand in front of their computer, which will then show the user with different outfits on. One concern I have for this though, is that generating images with AI is still an incredibly slow and expensive process, so doing this live would be unrealistic, and might also prove to be costly on our end.
