# Future Developments

## User Login

Currently, the login process lacks essential security features. In future iterations, users will be required to verify their email addresses upon account creation. Additionally, account management capabilities will be expanded—users will be able to update their login information (name, email, and password) and delete their accounts if desired.

## Handling Missing Clothing

At present, ClimateCloset selects outfits based solely on items uploaded by the user. This means that if a user specifies an activity such as a formal event but has only uploaded casual clothing (e.g., a t-shirt and jeans), the app will still suggest those items. Similarly, if no photos of footwear have been uploaded, the outfit will exclude shoes. To improve this, future versions of ClimateCloset will incorporate an internal “default closet” containing versatile clothing options. This will ensure that outfit suggestions remain complete and contextually appropriate even when user-uploaded items are limited or missing.

## Clothing Log

To enhance variety and realism in outfit suggestions, ClimateCloset will introduce a clothing log system. This feature will track daily outfit usage to avoid recommending the same clothing items on consecutive days. Users will also be able to indicate when they have done laundry, resetting the clothing log and reintroducing previously worn items into the outfit rotation.
