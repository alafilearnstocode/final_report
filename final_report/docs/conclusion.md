# Conclusion

In conclusion, our product, ClimateCloset, is an effective solution to the challenge of weather-appropriate outfit planning, particularly for international students adjusting to the unfamiliar Evanston climate. By integrating real-time weather data with user-uploaded wardrobe content, ClimateCloset helps users make informed clothing decisions that prioritize both comfort and confidence. Our prototype includes a weather-based outfit recommendation system, user-uploaded clothes, and tagging functionality. <br />

We believe ClimateCloset has the potential to evolve into a comprehensive digital wardrobe assistant that supports sustainability and user well-being.
