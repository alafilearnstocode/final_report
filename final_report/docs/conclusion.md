# Conclusion

In conclusion, our product, *ClimateCloset*, is an effective solution to the challenge of weather-appropriate outfit planning, particularly for international students adjusting to the unfamiliar Evanston climate. By integrating real-time weather data with user-uploaded wardrobe content, ClimateCloset helps users make informed clothing decisions that prioritize both comfort and confidence. The system fulfills all key requirements outlined in Users and Requirements.

Our prototype includes the following features:
