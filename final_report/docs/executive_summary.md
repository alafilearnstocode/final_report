# Executive Summary

## Problem
User interviews and background research reveal that many Northwestern incoming students from outside the Midwest have trouble appropriately dressing for the weather. 

## Users and Requirements
The objective of this project is to design and create a method for students to dress more appropriately for the weather. The initial requirements fell into four categories: personalization, functionality, accessibility, and cost. Specific metrics used to evaluate each requirement are listed in Users and Requirements. Our target users are individuals from regions such as the West, the South, or even abroad who are unfamiliar with the volatile Midwest weather.

## Design Concept and Rationale 

The design that we have created is called the ClimateCloset. It is a mobile and desktop app designed to help Northwestern students from outside the Midwest dress appropriately for local weather. Users upload photos of their clothing and input their location. The app then classifies the clothing and builds a virtual wardrobe. Each day, ClimateCloset suggests a weather-appropriate outfit, which users can customize or update with new items. Afterward, users provide feedback on warmth and style, helping the algorithm improve over time.

<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "space-between" }}>
  <div style={{ flex: 1, marginRight: "10px", textAlign: "center" }}>
    <img src="/img/exec-1.png" alt="Figure 1" style={{ width: "100%" }} />
    <p><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Desktop Homepage (1)</p>
  </div>
  <div style={{ flex: 1, marginLeft: "10px", textAlign: "center" }}>
    <img src="/img/exec-2.png" alt="Figure 2" style={{ width: "100%" }} />
    <p><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Desktop Homepage (2)</p>
  </div>
</div>


## Future Development/Next Steps
While our ClimateCloset design shows promise in helping users dress appropriately for the weather, there are still opportunities for refinement to enhance privacy, security, functionality, and reliability. For example, securing the user login process with email verification and allowing users to manage their account details would improve data safety and user control. Introducing a default internal wardrobe would help generate complete outfits even if users havenâ€™t uploaded certain items, such as shoes or formal wear. Lastly, a clothing log feature that tracks recent outfits and lets users reset it after doing laundry would prevent repeated suggestions and create a more personalized experience.
