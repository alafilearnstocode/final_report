# Executive Summary

## Problem
Our team identified the problem of Northwestern students outside the midwest having trouble appropriately dressing for the weather. 

## Purpose and Requirements:
Our project was designed to design a method for students to more effectively dress for the weather. The initial requirements fell into four categories: personalization, functionality, accessibility, and cost. Additional requirements specific to ClimateCloset were added after user testing. These requirements are listed in Users and Requirements.

## Methodology:
Throughout the design process, our team conducted user testing using four different mockups. Our interview and observation guide is listed in Appendix [[L]](./appendices/interview_guide).

### Design Overview:
ClimateCloset’s key features are listed in the table below:

| **Feature**                                                | **Benefits**                                                                                     |
|------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Uploading photos of clothes                                | Personalized output based on the user’s actual wardrobe                                          |
| Inputting activity level, time out, and occasion           | Outfit is generated based on context i.e weather, activity, and time outdoors                        |
| Weather information                                         | User knows what the weather throughout the day will look like and how to dress accordingly       |
| Style suggestions from default closet                      | Ensures recommendations are always provided even if the user hasn’t uploaded sufficient clothes |
| User feedback for outfit approval                          | Refines recommendations based on what the user confirms they wore or preferred                  |
| Footwear and accessory detection (if photos are provided)  | More complete and practical outfit suggestions                                                   |

These tests allowed our team to design ClimateCloset.
